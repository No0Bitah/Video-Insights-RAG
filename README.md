# Video-Insights-RAG

This project combines Whisper for accurate speech-to-text transcription and Gemma 3 for natural language understanding, enabling powerful video analysis. With it, you can automatically generate transcripts, create concise summaries, and ask questions about any video. The goal is to make video content searchable, understandable, and easy to work with using modern LLMs.

⚠️ Note: This project is still under development.
